**Batch-Rendering**

A 2D Batch Rendering Engine made in Java and OpenGL.

Main Feature: Rendering a loads of sprites with minimal draw calls to the GPU.

Here is an image showing the batch renderer in effect. Its drawing a 50x50 world(yes, I am infact drawing sprites that we cannot see JUST BECAUSE i want to test the performance).

FYI. The image is from a project that I'm currently working on so it's not uploaded in github yet!
